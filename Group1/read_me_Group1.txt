Data are divided in topologies. In particular, the configuration
of the players in Path Graph is: #1-2-3-4-5-6
whereas the player in the central position in the Star graph is the player #2.

In each folder, you can find raw data and interpolated and filtered version of them. 
In particular, the position time-series of each player is sampled at 10Hz. 
Data were interpolated through a spline to obtain a 100Hz sampling. 
Then, the position time-series were filtered through a Butterworth filter with a 
cutoff frequency equal to twice the typical human natural movement frequency (âˆ¼3 Hz).

Volunteers performed 4 trials of 75 seconds each: 
15s-Eyes closed + 30s-Eyes closed + 30s-Eyes closed
